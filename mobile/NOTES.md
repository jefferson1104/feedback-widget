### Install Expo and init project
You must have **Node** and **NPM** installed on your machine, with this now installing **Expo**, run the command below:
```bash

```

After installing the expo, let's start a **React Native** project, with the following commands, but first make sure you install the app called **Expo Go** on your smartphone.
```bash
  # Init project
  $ expo init NAME_PROJECT
  # Choose a template: â€º blank (TypeScript)  same as blank but with TypeScript configuration

  # Run project
  $ expo start --clear
```
With your smartphone connected to the same network as your computer, scan the **QR Code** and your project will open with the **Expo Go** app.
